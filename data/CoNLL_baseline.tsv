3275	3275	Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .	[]	[]	[]	['china']	[]
3276	3276	Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .	[]	[]	[]	set()	[]
3277	3277	Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .	[]	[]	[]	['china']	[]
3278	3278	It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .	[]	[]	[]	set()	[]
3279	3279	Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .	[]	[]	[]	set()	[]

3283	3283	Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .	[]	[]	[]	set()	[]
3284	3284	Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .	[]	[]	[]	['london']	[]
3285	3285	A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .	[]	[]	[]	set()	[]
3286	3286	CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .	[]	[]	[]	['april']	[]
3287	3287	Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .	[]	[]	[]	['asia']	[]
3288	3288	This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .	[]	[]	[]	set()	[]
