mounted 0
last 0

that 0
Lebed I-PER
was 0
operating 0
out 0
on 0
a 0
limb 0
in 0
Chechnya 0
as 0
Yeltsin I-PER
hardly 0
seen 0
since 0
his 0

last 0

kept 0
out 0
of 0

and 0
then 0
gave 0
an 0
interview 0
criticising 0
his 0
envoy 0
just 0
as 0
he 0
clinched 0
a 0
truce 0

But 0
Chernomyrdin I-PER
took 0
pains 0
at 0
the 0
weekend 0
to 0
insist 0
Lebed I-PER
was 0
playing 0
for 0
a 0
united 0
team 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
proposals 0
he 0
took 0
to 0
rebel 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
Aslan I-PER
Maskhadov I-PER
had I-PER
been 0
agreed 0
by 0
Yeltsin I-PER

If 0
that 0
were 0
the 0
case 0
it 0
was 0
unclear 0
why 0
Lebed I-PER
suddenly 0
found 0
it 0
necessary 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
deal 0
verified 0
in 0
Moscow 0

Lebed I-PER
himself 0
said 0

was 0
concerned 0
that 0
powerful 0
interests 0
in 0
Moscow 0
who 0
have 0
profited 0
from 0
the 0
war 0

want 0
it 0

go 0
on 0
would 0
seize 0
on 0
any 0
inadequacy 0
in 0
the 0
deal 0
to 0
remove 0
him 0

Maskhadov I-PER
warned 0
that 0
Lebed I-PER
risked 0
the 0
same 0
fate 0
as 0
a 0
former 0
Russian 0
army 0
commander 0
in 0

sought 0

forces 0

Maskhadov I-PER
may 0

demands 0
on 0

him 0
to 0
check 0
back 0

Kremlin 0

what 0
he 0
could 0
offer 0

A 0

spokesman 0
said 0
the 0
two 0
military 0
men 0
had 0
come 0
close 0
to 0
agreement 0
on 0
a 0
face 0
saving 0
formula 0
acceptable 0
to 0
both 0
sides 0
and 0
involving 0
a 0
referendum 0
on 0
independence 0
at 0
some 0
future 0
date 0

Chernomyrdin I-PER
said 0
voters 0
should 0
decide 0
Chechnya 0
's 0
future 0
but 0
stressed 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
question 0
of 0
the 0
government 0
letting 0
the 0
region 0
quit 0
the 0
Russian 0
Federation 0
something 0
Moscow 0
fears 0

separatist 0
tendencies 0
in 0

regions 0

in 0

finding 0
that 0
closing 0

The 0
European 0
Commission 0
said 0
on 0
Thursday 0
it 0
would 0
study 0
scientific 0
reports 0
saying 0
Britain 0
's 0

would 0
die 0
out 0
by 0
2001 0
but 0
offered 0
little 0
prospect 0
the 0
findings 0
would 0
change 0
an 0
agreed 0
slaughter 0
campaign 0

" 0
Obviously 0
we 0
are 0
interested 0
in 0
this 0
research 0

We 0
will 0
ask 0
the 0
EU 0
scientific 0
and 0
veterinary 0
committee 0
to 0
examine 0
it 0
" 0
Commission 0
spokesman 0
Gerard I-PER
Kiely I-PER
told 0
Reuters 0

But 0
he 0
added 0
that 0
new 0
research 0
into 0
the 0
dynamics 0
of 0
the 0
bovine 0
spongiform 0
encephalopathy 0
BSE 0
a 0
fatal 0
brain 0
wasting 0
disease 0
suffered 0
by 0
cattle 0
was 0
unlikely 0
to 0
alter 0
a 0
slaughter 0
plan 0
agreed 0
by 0
Britain 0
and 0
its 0
14 0
EU 0
partners 0

" 0
We 0
agreed 0
that 0
following 0
detailed 0
scientific 0
analysis 0
using 0
a 0
methodology 0
which 0
would 0
take 0
out 0
the 0
maximum 0
number 0
of 0
BSE 0
cases 0
possible 0

I 0
think 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
very 0
difficult 0
to 0
sell 0
to 0
the 0
European 0
Commission 0
a 0
programme 0
which 0
would 0
involve 0
the 0
elimination 0
of 0
fewer 0
BSE 0
cases 0
" 0
Kiely I-PER
said 0

" 0
We 0
will 0
look 0
at 0
our 0
approach 0
to 0
the 0
plan 0
but 0
we 0
wo 0
n't 0
get 0
involved 0
with 0
the 0
number 0
of 0

to 0
be 0
slaughtered 0
" 0
he 0
said 0

" 0
We 0
have 0
always 0
avoided 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
numbers 0
of 0
animals 0
to 0
be 0
slaughtered 0
that 0
's 0
not 0
the 0
issue 0

The 0
issue 0
is 0
the 0
protection 0
of 0
consumers 0
' 0
health 0
and 0
the 0
rapid 0
eradication 0
of 0
BSE 0
" 0
he 0
added 0

The 0
reaction 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
disappoint 0
British 0
farmers 0
who 0
seized 0
on 0
research 0
by 0
Oxford 0
scientists 0
in 0
the 0

it 0

faster 0
than 0
2001 0

there 0
was 0
no 0

of 0

" 0
The 0
new 0
evidence 0
to 0
me 0
means 0
some 0
of 0
that 0
proposal 0
should 0
be 0
re 0
examined 0
because 0
we 0
could 0
get 0
away 0

Naish I-PER

could 0
well 0

slapped 0

included 0
a 0
less 0

to 0

it 0
from 0

markets 0

Looking 0
at 0
market 0
prospects 0
he 0
said 0
" 0
I 0
think 0
our 0
best 0
judgment 0
at 0
this 0
stage 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
will 0
probably 0
bumble 0
along 0
in 0
the 0
rather 0
mixed 0
way 0
it 0
's 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
half 0
" 0

" 0
It 0
's 0
very 0
difficult 0
to 0
predict 0
the 0
market 0

this 0

It 0
could 0
be 0
better 0
or 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
worse 0

the 0

uncertainty 0
across 0

" 0
I 0
think 0
the 0
difference 0
now 0

the 0
first 0
half 0

not 0
actually 0
been 0
as 0
bad 0
as 0
some 0
felt 0
it 0
was 0

equally 0
we 0

Against 0
this 0

Hope I-PER

the 0

was 0
glad 0
it 0
had 0
rationalised 0
and 0
destocked 0
even 0
though 0
this 0
had 0
pressed 0
margins 0
which 0
had 0
slipped 0
to 0
9 0
5 0
percent 0
from 0
11 0
3 0
percent 0
a 0
year 0
ago 0

" 0
I 0
think 0
the 0
figure 0
of 0
9 0
5 0
percent 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
half 0
when 0
you 0
consider 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
we 0
've 0
been 0
destocking 0
the 0
fairly 0
mixed 0
customer 0
demand 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
we 0
sold 0
the 0
southern 0
African 0
mines 0
actually 0
is 0
not 0
bad 0

" 0
It 0
does 0
show 0
how 0
easily 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
bounce 0
back 0
over 0
10 0
percent 0
again 0
" 0
he 0
added 0
saying 0
" 0
We 0
continue 0
to 0
feel 0
very 0
relaxed 0
about 0
our 0
general 0
view 0
that 0
we 0
would 0
average 0
10 0

over 0

" 0
We 0
've 0
always 0
taken 0
the 0
view 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
the 0
sort 0
of 0
company 0
that 0
's 0
quite 0
capable 0
of 0

Hope I-PER

" 0
When 0
the 0
profit 0
figures 0

up 0

that 0
a 0
new 0
Treasury 0
secretary 0
might 0
favour 0
a 0
return 0
to 0
Bentsen 0
era 0

for 0

Widness I-PER
explained 0
that 0
Alan I-PER
Greenspan I-PER
's 0
reappointment 0
as 0
chairman 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Reserve 0
and 0
the 0
outlook 0
for 0
the 0
federal 0
budget 0
were 0
more 0
important 0
than 0
whether 0
Rubin I-PER
continues 0
at 0
the 0
Treasury 0

" 0
Although 0
if 0
we 0
did 0
get 0
someone 0
that 0
was 0
seen 0
as 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
dollar 0
depreciation 0
it 0
would 0
probably 0
hurt 0
capital 0
flows 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
" 0
said 0
Widness I-PER
adding 0
that 0
could 0
hurt 0
U 0
S 0
stocks 0
and 0
to 0
a 0
lesser 0
degree 0
bonds 0

Still 0
markets 0
may 0
have 0
little 0
to 0
fear 0
from 0
any 0
Rubin I-PER
successor 0
because 0
the 0
firm 0
dollar 0
policy 0
has 0
yielded 0
positive 0
results 0

If 0
that 0
is 0
true 0
then 0
any 0
new 0
Treasury 0
chief 0
would 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
as 0
effective 0
as 0
Rubin I-PER
in 0
convincing 0
markets 0
that 0
the 0
White 0

does 0
indeed 0
want 0
a 0
strong 0

" 0
If 0

And 0
all 0
I 0
can 0

that 0
even 0
if 0
the 0

met 0
by 0

his 0

was 0
for 0
a 0

about 0
150 0
000 0

living 0
off 0

would 0
not 0

to 0
order 0

for 0
the 0

even 0
against 0
the 0
wishes 0
of 0
the 0
government 0
in 0
Kinshasa 0
and 0
the 0
Zairean 0
rebels 0
who 0
control 0
much 0
of 0

he 0
said 0

" 0
Tomorrow 0
I 0
'm 0

saw 0
rebel 0
leader 0
Laurent I-PER
Kabila I-PER
in 0
Goma 0
last 0

but 0
the 0
rebels 0
told 0
him 0
the 0
crisis 0
was 0
over 0
because 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
Rwandan 0

have 0
already 0
gone 0

do 0
not 0

control 0
of 0
the 0
area 0

Kinshasa 0
opposes 0

Canadian 0
Defence 0

Doug I-PER

said 0
on 0

that 0

probably 0
not 0

to 0
make 0

intervene 0
militarily 0

any 0
major 0
way 0

" 0
It 0
does 0
n't 0
look 0

though 0
they 0
airdrops 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
required 0
in 0
any 0
significant 0
way 0
because 0

" 0
Young I-PER
told 0

But 0
General 0
Baril I-PER
said 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
premature 0
to 0
rule 0
out 0
any 0
course 0
of 0
action 0
until 0
he 0
had 0
more 0
information 0

" 0
We 0
hope 0
that 0
if 0
the 0

forward 0

will 0
have 0
access 0

" 0
If 0
