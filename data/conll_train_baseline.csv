The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep . 	[]
Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer . 	['Werner', 'Zwingmann']
""" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it "" the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing . "	['Nikolaus', 'van', 'der', 'Pas']
He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union . 	[]
He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health . 	['Franz', 'Fischler']
Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . 	['Fischler']
But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee mational animal health officials questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health . 	['Fischler']
"Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through "" dangerous generalisation . "" "	['Loyola', 'de', 'Palacio', 'Fischler']
. 	[]
Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal . 	['Fischler']
The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials . 	[]
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . 	[]
British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe . 	[]
""" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead "" Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio . "	['John', 'Lloyd', 'Jones']

""" Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries "" ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television . "	['Werner', 'Zwingmann']
""" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers "" he added . "" "	[]
"There are too many holes in what we know and these must be filled very quickly . "" "	[]
Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef . 	[]
The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified . 	[]
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . 	['Franz', 'Fischler']
But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health . 	[]
The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees . 	[]
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . 	[]
British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat . 	[]
ZDF said Germany imported sheep from Britain last year nearly half of total imports . 	[]
It brought in tonnes of British mutton some 10 percent of overall imports . 	[]
After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports . 	[]
EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease . 	[]

Garlic pills do n't lower cholesterol study finds . 	[]
LONDON 1996-08-22 	[]
Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed British researchers have reported . 	[]
A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets . 	[]
The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels . 	[]
"They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . "" "	[]
"There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo "" they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians . "	[]
Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period . 	[]
The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate . 	[]
Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol . 	[]
But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short . 	[]
The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets . 	[]
The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol . 	[]

Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round . 	[]

Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks . 	['Sampras']
While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus .

Defiant U.S. neo-Nazi jailed by German court . 	[]

A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States . 	['Gary', 'Lauck']
Lauck from Lincoln Nebraska yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred . 	['Lauck']
""" The struggle will go on "" the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards . "	[]
Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law . 	['Lauck']
The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism . 	[]
Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s . 	['Lauck']
""" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine honed during more than 20 years "" presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court . "	['Lauck', 'Guenter', 'Bertram']
""" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . "" "	[]
"said Bertram who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as "" the greatest of all leaders "" and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth . "	['Bertram', 'Lauck', 'Hitler']
Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 . 	['Lauck', 'Bernd', 'Mauruschat']
He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence . 	[]
Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books magazines videos and flags in his homeland . 	['Lauck']
"Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he "" welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications "" . "	['Manfred', 'Kanther']
""" It is high time he was behind bars "" the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement . "	[]
Lauck dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision . 	['Lauck', 'Bertram']
But as Lauck was about to be led away he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court . 	['Lauck']
""" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen "" he shouted in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . "" "	[]
"That 's the truth . "" "	[]
His attorney Hans-Otto Sieg told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States . 	['Hans-Otto', 'Sieg']
Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party . 	['Bertram', 'Lauck', 'Hitler']
"During the three-month trial the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's "" NS Kampfruf "" ( "" National Socialist Battle Cry "" ) magazine filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews . "	[]
The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities was illegal . 	['Sieg', 'Lauck']
Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations . 	['Lauck']
He will probably be free in around two and a half years . 	[]
The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term . 	[]

"Media baron Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday but forecast that the hit film "" Independence Day "" would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 . "	['Rupert', 'Murdoch']
""" From an earnings perspective the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day ' "" News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 1996 . "	[]
"It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . "" "	[]
"A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable "" News Corp said . "	[]
The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 . 	[]
News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 1.26 billion ( US$ 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents . 	[]
Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 1.343 billion . 	[]
""" The year just gone was disappointing but the outlook for the current year looks good "" First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond said . "	['Lachlan', 'Drummond']
News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from News Corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations . 	[]
"Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . "" "	[]
"Throughout the group higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 300 million "" it said . "	[]
News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs . 	[]
Advertising revenues at The Times grew 20 percent . 	[]
Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 . 	[]
News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide . 	[]
News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation . 	[]
It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper-Collins had not helped . 	[]
The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out . 	[]
But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement . 	[]
""" If they 're saying at least 20 percent then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent "" said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named . "	[]

Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement . 	[]
Ukraine 's declaration of independence in 1991 backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow . 	[]
Ukraine with a Russian community of 11 million people -- the world 's largest outside Russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya neighbouring Moldova and the former Soviet republics of Georgia Azerbaijan and Tajikistan . 	[]
""" Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony "" President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week . "	['Leonid', 'Kuchma']
""" Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . "" "	[]
But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse although there are signs of a turnaround . 	[]
Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow . 	[]
"Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that "" there was a turning point "" in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future . "	['Kuchma']
""" There is no doubt that economic growth has already started "" said Adelbert Knobl head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . "" "	['Adelbert', 'Knobl']
"The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . "" "	[]
"Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would "" definitely "" be introduced before the end of this year . "	[]
It will replace the interim karbovanets currency which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble . 	[]
Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems . 	[]
Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public if unofficial visit . 	[]
China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest . 	[]
Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting . 	['Hennady', 'Udovenko']
But Ukraine seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe is looking West as well as East . 	[]
""" The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas . "	[]
"Relations with Russia which is our main partner have great importance "" Kuchma said . "	['Kuchma']
""" But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia even though those in some circles push us to do that . "" "	[]
Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO . 	['Kuchma']
"A message from the West this week from U.S. President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a "" stabilising factor "" in a united Europe . "	['Bill', 'Clinton']
Oldest Albania book disappears from Vatican - paper . 	[]
TIRANA 1996-08-23 	[]
A 16th-century document the earliest complete example of written Albanian has disappeared from the Vatican archives an Albanian newspaper said on Friday . 	[]
"Gazeta Shqiptare said the "" Book of Mass ' by Gjon Buzuku dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in Rome was the first major document published in the Albanian language . "	['Gjon', 'Buzuku']
""" We Albanians sons of Buzuku believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more "" lamented scholar Musa Hamiti told of the loss by the Vatican library . "	['Musa', 'Hamiti']
"Tirana 's national library has three copies of the "" Book of Mass ' . "" "	[]
"There is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies "" Gazeta Shqiptare said . "	[]
Russia to clamp down on barter deals . 	[]
MOSCOW 1996-08-23 	[]
Russian officials keen to cut capital flight will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum a customs official said on Friday . 	[]
""" We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia "" Marina Volkova deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee told Reuters . "	['Marina', 'Volkova']
Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals with nothing imported in return . 	['Volkova']
She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 . 	[]
Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion she said . 	[]
""" The cost of exported goods is too often understated so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher "" Volkova said . "	['Volkova']
"A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals and Volkova said this "" could substantially improve the situation "" . "	['Boris', 'Yeltsin', 'Volkova']
In line with the decree which will come into force on November 1 all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days . 	[]
""" If traders are late they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods "" Volkova said . "	['Volkova']
"Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers but Volkova said the authorities are currently "" tackling the technicalities of the issue "" . "	['Volkova']
Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus . 	['Yeltsin']
"A few years ago barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because "" thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems "" Volkova said . "	['Volkova']
""" Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones . "	[]
"But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high "" she said . "	[]

BRUSSELS 1996-08-23 	[]
Russia 's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova smashed her second world record in just 10 days on Friday when she bettered the mark for the women 's metres . 	['Svetlana', 'Masterkova']
After breaking the world record for the women 's mile in Zurich last Wednesday the Olympic 800 and metres champion clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds over at the Brussels grand prix meeting . 	[]
The Russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best of 2:29.34 set by Mozambique 's Maria Mutola in the same stadium in August last year . 	['Maria', 'Mutola']
Former world 800 champion Mutola pushed Masterkova all the way finishing second in 2:29.66 . 	['Mutola', 'Masterkova']
But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ for the historic run in front of a capacity crowd . 	[]
Masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break . 	['Masterkova']
In her first mile race at the richest meeting in Zurich last Wednesday she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record . 	[]
The record of four minutes 12.56 seconds in Zurich earned Masterkova a bonus of $ plus one kilo of gold . 	['Masterkova']
After Friday 's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ in less than a fortnight taking her appearance money into account . 	[]
Brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface . 	[]
Masterkova clearly enjoyed it . 	['Masterkova']
Mutola looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line . 	['Mutola']

Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom . 	['Johnson', 'Roger', 'Kingdom']

Jackson the only man to have run faster could not live with his speed taking second in 13.24 seconds . 	['Jackson']
The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race . 	[]

Jamaican Commonwealth champion Michelle Freeman took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez . 	['Michelle', 'Freeman', 'Aliuska', 'Lopez']
The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in Oslo Zurich Brussels and Berlin . 	['Engquist']
Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men 's 400 metres hurdles champion Derrick Adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 . 	['Derrick', 'Adkins']

Colombia U.S. reach aviation agreement . 	[]
MIAMI 1996-08-23 	[]
The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow AMR Corp 's American Airlines to operate three round-trip flights between New York and Bogota the Department of Transportation said Friday . 	[]
Under the agreement which followed talks in Miami this week AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway . 	[]
The United States also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years . 	[]
Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the Federal Aviation Administration 's International Aviation Safety program . 	[]
Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved the department said . 	[]
With the exception of the new services just agreed to the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years the agreement said . 	[]
The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American 's request to operate flights between New York and Bogota a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines Avianca and ACES .

For the first time in Israeli history an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday . 	[]
Hapoel Taibe fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports -- a Pole and a Romanian . 	[]
The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs . 	[]
The club founded in 1961 has a loyal following in Taibe an Arab town of in the heart of Israel . 	[]
But away from their home ground they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse . 	[]
""" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem "" said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye . "	['Karem', 'Haj', 'Yihye']
Two weeks ago Taibe coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek met Betar a club closely associated with the right-wing Likud party for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem . 	['Wojtek', 'Lazarek']

""" We 're used to hearing the taunts of "" Death to the Arabs ' "" said Sameh Haj Yihye a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University . "" "	['Sameh', 'Haj', 'Yihye']
"But we know that these are only words nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . "" "	[]
The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination . 	[]
""" There are no parks or empty areas of land around here so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv "" 60 km ( 36 miles ) away Sameh Haj Yihye said . "	['Sameh', 'Haj', 'Yihye']
The town 's ramshackle ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks . 	[]

"We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . "" "	[]
In the meantime Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya . 	[]
""" We are Israelis there is no question about that "" said Karem Haj Yihye a hotel waiter . "	['Karem', 'Haj', 'Yihye']
""" We do n't have any connection with the Palestinians they live over there "" he said pointing to the West Bank seven km ( four miles ) to the east . "	[]

OPTIONS - Euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall . 	[]
LONDON 1996-08-23 	[]
Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's German-led cut in interest rates traders said . 	[]
""" Volatility has come off a lot . "	[]
"We 're looking for it to stabilise now "" said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank . "	[]
A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract 16.75 for December 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June . 	[]
This compared with midweek levels before the welter of interest rate cuts of 18.50 for September 20.00 for December 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June he said . 	[]
At 1347 GMT December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78 two basis points down on the day . 	[]
He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone which could offer value at current levels . 	[]
He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end . 	[]
The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent took markets by surprise . 	[]
""" Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol "" he said . "	[]

LONDON 1996-08-23 	[]
A British photographer branded a stalker by Princess Diana has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage his lawyer said on Friday . 	['Diana']

CHICAGO 1996-08-22 	[]
A consortium of telephone companies and The Walt Disney Co . 	[]
said Thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service . 	[]
The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith which has struggled with years of losses . 	[]
""" This really indicates we 're back in the business "" William Luehrs president of the Glenview Ill.-based company 's Networks Services Division said in a telephone interview . "" "	['William', 'Luehrs']
"Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . "" "	[]
Following the announcement Zenith 's stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the New York Stock Exchange . 	[]
The consortium called Americast said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment . 	[]
In addition to Disney Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. BellSouth Corp. GTE Corp. and SBC Communications . 	[]
Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television . 	[]
Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in Woodridge Ill . 	[]
to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets . 	[]
The company currently buys the tubes from competitors . 	[]
The new plant which is dependent on obtaining financing will create about 280 new jobs Zenith said . 	[]
The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years . 	[]
Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year . 	['Luehrs']
The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis . 	[]
Zenith will convert its Chihuahua Mexico analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes . 	[]
Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable . 	['Luehrs']
Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service . 	[]
Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States . 	[]
Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics . 	['Luehrs']
""" We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets for digital television "" he said . "" "	[]
"Although that is not where this particular contract is headed the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . "" "	[]
Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry reporting full-year losses since 1989 . 	[]

Natural Law Party says it can meditate problems away . 	[]
WASHINGTON 1996-08-22 	[]
"From the people who brought you hundreds of "" yogic fliers "" who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes The Natural Law Party a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday . "	[]
At a hotel convention here the party associated with the Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) movement named physicist John Hagelin as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election . 	['John', 'Hagelin']
The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress crime terrorism and even wars . 	[]
""" Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease "" said a party paper . "	[]

Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations . 	[]
Martin Wolk 	['Martin', 'Wolk']
SEATTLE 1996-08-22 	[]
A year after its massively publicized introduction Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry . 	[]
Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold making it the fastest-selling new software ever it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 1995 launch when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers . 	[]
The Redmond Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme . 	['Redmond']
But the product delivered eight months late has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers analysts said . 	[]
""" It did n't do as well as it could have "" said Rob Enderle an analyst with Giga Information Group . "	['Rob', 'Enderle']
Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized . 	[]
""" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed "" said Scott Winkler an analyst with Gartner Group . "	['Scott', 'Winkler']
""" It 's not as though it has n't had an impact "" he said . "" "	[]
"It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . "" "	[]
Symantec Corp. which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections . 	[]
Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch . 	[]
Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products said Ann Stephens president of PC Data Inc . 	['Ann', 'Stephens']
To be sure sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company . 	[]
Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows now used on about 100 million computers worldwide . 	[]
But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system . 	['Enderle']
He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks . 	[]
""" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer "" Winkler said . "" "	['Winkler']
"Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . "" "	[]
But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 . 	['Winkler']
""" Windows 95 is going to do great "" he said . "" "	[]
"The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast sweeping change rather than a slow building change . "" "	[]
U.S. says still committed to Cuba migration pacts . 	[]
WASHINGTON 1996-08-22 	[]
The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter U.S. territory illegally . 	[]
A State Department statement appeared in part a response to Cuban complaints that Washington was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the Cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents . 	[]
""" The United States reiterates its full commitment to the implementation "" of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 said the statement by spokesman Glyn Davies . "	['Glyn', 'Davies']
""" The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally "" it said . "	[]
"Washington would also take "" prompt and effective law enforcement action "" against alien smuggling and hijackings from Cuba it added . "	[]
"Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami "" to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits "" from Cuba to Florida . "	['Davies']
Havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba . 	[]
Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay a U.S. base on Cuba until they emigrated to another nation . 	[]
The most recent hijacking last Friday involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft . 	[]
Davies said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to Cuba but U.S. authorities planned to try the hijackers . 	['Davies']
In an incident on July 7 a Cuban interior ministry official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at Guantanamo Bay . 	[]
Davies said he knew of no plans to return the man to Cuba . 	['Davies']

Tommy Thompson said Thursday . 	['Tommy', 'Thompson']
According to a new release from the governor Wisconsin submitted a plan to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President Bill Clinton signed the measure into law Thursday . 	['Bill', 'Clinton']
""" As the nation 's leader in welfare reform Wisconsin is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system "" Thompson said . "	['Thompson']
Still the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program dubbed W-2 . 	[]
He said that despite the new law Wisconsin will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents . 	[]
The nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children . 	[]

China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade . 	[]
Lynne O'Donnell 	"['Lynne', ""O'Donnell""]"
HONG KONG 1996-08-23 	[]
Up to tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve industry sources said on Friday . 	[]
Around tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou where some of the strategic stockpile was stored they said . 	[]
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July . 	[]
It was unclear whether or not the tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission owned the copper . 	[]
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise . 	[]
But one source the head of a Hong Kong trading house said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not . 	[]
""" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou it will be sitting there for years "" he said . "	[]
""" Once it arrives in Yingkou it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders "" he said . "	[]
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months with traders unsure not only of who owns it but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it . 	[]
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) . 	[]
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price . 	[]
CNIEC lent around tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve running the state stockpile down to tonnes from tonnes previously . 	[]
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ a tonne and then paid somewhere between $ and $ a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year . 	[]
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs . 	[]
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market . 	[]
"Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the tonnes "" whoever they are is the most important short-term fundamental "" in an already tight world market . "	[]
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals . 	[]
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement . 	[]
Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses . 	[]
They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases . 	[]
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market . 	[]
But these concerns were irrelevant a Singapore trader said despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year . 	[]
"As with many commodities "" there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal "" he said . "" "	[]
"You do n't keep it to help industry you keep it in case of emergency . "" "	[]

SOCCER - DISAPPOINTING AJAX SLUMP 2-0 AT HEERENVEEN . 	[]
AMSTERDAM 1996-08-24 	[]
Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at Heerenveen . 	[]
Ajax who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock . 	[]
Eight minutes after the interval Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net . 	['Romeo', 'Wouden', 'John', 'Veldman', 'Edwin', 'van', 'der', 'Sar']
Ajax without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise . 	['Marcio', 'Santos', 'Winston', 'Bogarde', 'Jari', 'Litmanen', 'Marc', 'Overmars']
But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar . 	['Jon', 'Dahl', 'Tomasson', 'van', 'der', 'Sar']
The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday . 	[]

"President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy "" making news "" -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year . "	['Bill', 'Clinton']
With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole . 	['Clinton', 'Bob', 'Dole']
"After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly "" announce "" a development in the war on crime . "	['Clinton']
""" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders "" Clinton said . "" "	['Clinton']
"That plan has now reached my desk . "" "	[]
""" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals not just in a single state but wherever they go "" he said . "	[]
Actually creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger . 	['Clinton']
Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established . 	['Janet', 'Reno']
Two months ago Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established . 	['Clinton']
Now 60 days later he had a chance to talk about it again . 	[]
It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election . 	['Clinton']
Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House they are part of his political chess game . 	['Clinton']

"According to a senior campaign official Clinton "" will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . "" "	['Clinton']
Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia Kentucky Ohio Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago . 	['Clinton']
""" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention "" said the campaign official . "" "	[]
"We think it 'll work really well . "" "	[]
"Although officials decline to say just what each day 's "" news "" will be the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention . "	['Clinton']
Each day of the trip will have a late start so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes . 	[]
"Campaign officials then hope the day 's "" news "" event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme . "	[]
""" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future "" said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry . "	['Mike', 'McCurry']
"McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience he will "" set out a road map "" for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years .

Italian comics hope independence-joke 's on Bossi . 	['Bossi']

A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome . 	['Umberto', 'Bossi']
"Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics including popular actor Roberto Benigni would declare Orvieto "" capital of Etruria "" on September 15 -- the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome . "	['Stefano', 'Cimicchi', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'Bossi']
""" We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia Corsica and Cyprus "" Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday . "	['Cimicchi']

""" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession "" he added . "	[]
Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally . 	['Bossi']
He has recently dropped a drive for federalism saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners . 	[]

VERONA Italy 1996-08-24 	[]
An Italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them the Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday . 	[]
It quoted the lawyer of Gianfranco Stevanin as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a Verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women . 	['Gianfranco', 'Stevanin']
"ANSA said Stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women remembering only that he had found them "" lifeless in his arms "" after having sadmasochistic sex with them . "	['Stevanin']
Stevanin arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute is accused of murdering five women three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside Verona between July and December 1995 . 	['Stevanin', 'Verona']
Two of the corpses were identified but not the third found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal . 	[]
Lawyer Cesare dal Maso told ANSA that Stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby Adige river . 	['Cesare', 'dal', 'Maso', 'Stevanin']

BRUSSELS 1996-08-24 	[]
Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe . 	[]
Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux managed to prey on children unhindered for so long . 	['Marc', 'Dutroux']
In just over a week two young girls have been found dead from starvation two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others . 	[]
On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at Mont-sur-Marchienne -- both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi . 	[]
Both houses are owned by Dutroux . 	['Dutroux']
Belgian media speculated that Dutroux charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children must have had high level protection to molest youngsters . 	['Dutroux']
"They put forward no proof to support the speculation but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case "" if I am allowed to "" . "	['Michel', 'Bourlet']
Bourlet said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized some of which featured Dutroux . 	['Bourlet', 'Dutroux']
Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi . 	['Dutroux']
Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses . 	['Dutroux']
Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo had been kidnapped in June last year . 	['Julie', 'Lejeune', 'Melissa', 'Russo']
Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later . 	['Dutroux']
He also admitted kidnapping two other girls An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks a year ago . 	['An', 'Marchal', 'Eefje', 'Lambrecks']
The fate of the girls is unknown but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor . 	['Dutroux']
Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague . 	[]
Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin charged as an accomplice . 	['Dutroux', 'Michelle', 'Martin']
The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association . 	[]
Dutch police are also holding a 74-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established . 	['An', 'Eefje']
At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling incompetence and indifference . 	['Dutroux']
"Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed "" Othello "" against Dutroux in 1995 -- when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped . "	['Dutroux', 'Julie', 'Melissa', 'An', 'Eefje']
They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was . 	['Dutroux']
They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours . 	['Dutroux', 'Julie', 'Melissa']
Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up . 	['Stefaan', 'De', 'Clerck']
There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support managed to own six houses . 	['Dutroux']

MOTORCYCLING - JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND NINE SUPERBIKE RACES . 	['NINE']
SUGO Japan 1996-08-25 	[]
Teenager Yuuichi Takeda racing in only his first season outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday . 	['Yuuichi', 'Takeda']
Takeda 18 showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser last year 's championship runner-up with four of the 25 laps left . 	['Takeda', 'Troy', 'Corser']
Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap . 	['Takeda', 'Corser', 'Noriyuki', 'Haga', 'Wataru', 'Yoshikawa', 'Haga']
But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third . 	['Takeda', 'Haga', 'Yoshikawa']
Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph . 	['Haga']
Corser who crashed during practice on Friday limped in fourth four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 11 seconds behind the winner . 	['Corser', 'Takeda', 'Aaron', 'Slight']
In the second race Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki . 	['Takeda', 'Takuma', 'Aoki']
Aoki the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag . 	['Aoki', 'Haruchika', 'John', 'Kocinski']
Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph and then by Takeda . 	['Kocinski', 'Aoki', 'Takeda']
With Takeda out of the race Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki . 	['Takeda', 'Kocinski', 'Aoki']
Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place . 	['Haga', 'Slight', 'Corser']
But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 280 points followed by Corser with 269 and Kocinski with 254 . 	['Slight', 'Corser', 'Kocinski']

CRICKET - POLLOCK CONCLUDES WARWICKSHIRE CAREER WITH FLOURISH . 	['POLLOCK']
LONDON 1996-08-25 	[]
South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock concluded his Warwickshire career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's Sunday league victory over Worcestershire . 	['Shaun', 'Pollock']
Pollock who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 154 . 	['Pollock']
After an hour 's interruption for rain Warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games . 	[]
Warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind Yorkshire Nottinghamshire and Surrey . 	[]
Yorkshire captain David Byas completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table reaching a career best 111 not out against Lancashire . 	['David', 'Byas']
Lancashire 's total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before Byas put their attack to the sword collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours . 	['Byas']
